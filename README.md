# Data-Requests
## Dataset Request Tracker

When filling out issues for newly requested datasets, please be sure to always include links to reference documentation about the dataset.  Such reference documentation should explain not only the schema of the dataset, but its history, usage, caveats, etc.  If the dataset is part of a regulatory framework, the reference documentation should explain that as well.  This documentation is **vital** to helping to document the data through the Data Commons Browser and deciding how to publish the data.
